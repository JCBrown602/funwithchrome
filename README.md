# funwithchrome - Learning about Chrome Extensions
I've been spending a lot of time on freeCodeCamp and I wanted to get more familiar with Git so I could version my projects. However, after some time pecking around at Javascript, and reading up on Git commands, I got distracted by Chrome extensions.

In the original distraction, I was following a tutorial (_need to find the link_) in which I wound up replacing the background on the Google homepage with a unicorn gif. That was neat, but now I'm trying to make something a bit more useful.
